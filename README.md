# Project : Designing stock market auction mechanism

# What it does:
This app is used to create an asset portfolio for users where they can store the records of their trades.
It has features like:<br><br>
Asset buy/sell control which can be used to enter the record of any new trade made by the user.<br>
An Order Book which keeps the records of all the buy and sell for each user.<br>
An information Box which displays the current market price which changes dynamically when new trade is made.<br>
Graph representation of all the trade records made till now.<br>

# How I built it:
I have used NodeJs as a backend Server for the Application and Mongodb to store the data in document Format<br>
I have also used Embedded JavaScript Templating view engine to show my data in frontend and Display All the parameters required.<br>
I have Used Chart.js to show the data in form of line chart and every value change in real Time.
